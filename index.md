The first giant calculator was designed and mounted in a Post Office
research centre, and then used in Bletchley Park.

Based on tubes and destroyed right after
the end of the war, so no credit until recently
as first computer (ENIAC)

.right-column[
### RSA

* first publicly available *public key encryption* scheme
* based on the properties of prime numbers and factorization
* very clever one way function
* can encrypt with a publicly distributed key
* can decrypt only with a private key
* makes it possible very fast exchange of secure messages

## Public key: RSA

.right-column[
### RSA fundamentals


The simplified form of the one way function is a product of two prime numbers:

```
N = p * v
```

* N is the public key
* p, v is the private key (very high prime numbers)
* try finding p and/or v from N...

A couple of functions exist so that:

```
message: m
encrypt: e = f(m, N)
decrpyt: m = g(e, p, v)

```

### RSA fundamentals

Interesting to note that similar results were alredy been found by

* James H. Ellis
* Clifford Cocks
* Malcolm J. Williamson

(UK Government) but could not be disclosed until 1997

James H. Ellis was using a combination of a message and noise as
public key.

* we can define sum and product as geometric functions

### Elliptic curve (ECC)

* product by itself: AxA=-C
* product multiple times: AxAxAxAx...=A^l=Q
* (A, Q points in the curve, l is a scalar)
* finding Q given A, l is easy; finding l given A and Q is too difficult
